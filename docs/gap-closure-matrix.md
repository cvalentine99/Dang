## 2. P0 Objective 1 — Close Remaining Phase 3 Endpoint Gaps

This objective addressed 26 Wazuh API endpoints that were present in the OpenAPI spec but had no corresponding tRPC procedure in the router. Each endpoint was implemented as a read-only `wazuhProcedure` with Zod input validation, proper path parameter handling, and pagination support where applicable.

### 2.1 Security Family (4 endpoints)

| tRPC Procedure | Wazuh API Path | Method | Parameters | Test File |
|----------------|----------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| `securityRbacRules` | `/security/rules` | GET | rule_ids, limit, offset, search, select, sort, q, distinct | `wazuhRouter.test.ts` |
| `securityActions` | `/security/actions` | GET | endpoint | `wazuhRouter.test.ts` |
| `securityResources` | `/security/resources` | GET | resource | `wazuhRouter.test.ts` |
| `securityCurrentUserPolicies` | `/security/users/me/policies` | GET | (none) | `wazuhRouter.test.ts` |

**Proof:** All four procedures are defined in `server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.ts`. Each accepts only GET-safe parameters and returns the Wazuh response envelope. Auth negative tests confirm unauthenticated callers receive `UNAUTHORIZED`.

**Verification:**
```bash
pnpm test -- --reporter=verbose server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts 2>&1 | grep -i "security"
```

### 2.2 Agent Lifecycle (4 endpoints)

| tRPC Procedure | Wazuh API Path | Method | Parameters | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|--------|------------|-------|
| `agentsUpgradeResult` | `/agents/upgrade_result` | GET | agents_list, q, limit, offset + agent filter params | Read-only despite "upgrade" in name |
| `agentsUninstallPermission` | `/agents/uninstall` | GET | (none) | Returns uninstall permission status |
| `agentGroupSync` | `/agents/{agent_id}/group/is_sync` | GET | agent_id (path) | Path param validated via Zod regex |
| `apiInfo` | `/` | GET | (none) | Root API info endpoint |

**Proof:** The `agentsUpgradeResult` procedure was flagged as a false positive by the write-operation detection test because its name contains "upgrade". The test fixture was corrected to recognize it as a GET endpoint. The `agentGroupSync` procedure uses the standard `agentIdSchema` regex validator.

**Verification:**
```bash
grep -A5 'agentsUpgradeResult:' server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.ts
grep -A5 'agentGroupSync:' server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.ts
```

### 2.3 Experimental Syscollector Bulk Endpoints (9 endpoints)

These endpoints provide fleet-wide syscollector data without requiring an `agent_id` path parameter. They are distinct from the per-agent syscollector endpoints already in the router.

| tRPC Procedure | Wazuh API Path | Method | Parameters |
|----------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| `expSyscollectorPackages` | `/experimental/syscollector/packages` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorProcesses` | `/experimental/syscollector/processes` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorPorts` | `/experimental/syscollector/ports` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorNetaddr` | `/experimental/syscollector/netaddr` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorNetiface` | `/experimental/syscollector/netiface` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorNetproto` | `/experimental/syscollector/netproto` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorOs` | `/experimental/syscollector/os` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorHardware` | `/experimental/syscollector/hardware` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |
| `expSyscollectorHotfixes` | `/experimental/syscollector/hotfixes` | GET | limit, offset, sort, search, select, q, distinct, agents_list |

**Proof:** All nine procedures share a common Zod schema (`expSyscollectorSchema`) that validates the universal pagination/filter parameters plus `agents_list`. Each procedure maps to the correct `/experimental/syscollector/{resource}` path.

**Out of scope:** `/experimental/syscollector/network` and `/experimental/syscollector/users` do not exist in the v4.14.3 spec and are explicitly excluded.

**Verification:**
```bash
grep 'expSyscollector' server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.ts | wc -l  # Should be 9+ definitions
```

### 2.4 Partial-Coverage Gaps (2 endpoints)

| tRPC Procedure | Wazuh API Path | Method | Parameters |
|----------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| `listsFileContent` | `/lists/files/{filename}` | GET | filename (path), raw |
| `groupFileContent` | `/groups/{group_id}/files/{file_name}` | GET | group_id (path), file_name (path), type, format |

**Proof:** Both procedures use path parameter interpolation with Zod-validated inputs. The `listsFileContent` procedure validates the filename against a safe-path regex to prevent path traversal.

### 2.5 Cluster Per-Node Endpoints (9 endpoints)

These endpoints provide node-specific cluster data, complementing the existing cluster-wide endpoints.

| tRPC Procedure | Wazuh API Path | Method | Parameters |
|----------------|----------------|--------|------------|
| `clusterNodeStatus` | `/cluster/{node_id}/status` | GET | node_id (path) |
| `clusterNodeConfiguration` | `/cluster/{node_id}/configuration` | GET | node_id (path), section, field, raw |
| `clusterNodeComponentConfig` | `/cluster/{node_id}/configuration/{component}/{configuration}` | GET | node_id, component, configuration (path) |
| `clusterNodeDaemonStats` | `/cluster/{node_id}/daemons/stats` | GET | node_id (path), daemons_list |
| `clusterNodeLogs` | `/cluster/{node_id}/logs` | GET | node_id (path), limit, offset, sort, search, tag, level, q |
| `clusterNodeLogsSummary` | `/cluster/{node_id}/logs/summary` | GET | node_id (path) |
| `clusterNodeStatsAnalysisd` | `/cluster/{node_id}/stats/analysisd` | GET | node_id (path) |
| `clusterNodeStatsRemoted` | `/cluster/{node_id}/stats/remoted` | GET | node_id (path) |
| `clusterNodeStatsWeekly` | `/cluster/{node_id}/stats/weekly` | GET | node_id (path) |

**Proof:** All nine procedures validate `node_id` via Zod string schema and interpolate it into the URL path. The `clusterNodeLogs` procedure includes full filter support matching the spec's query parameters.

**Verification:**
```bash
grep 'clusterNode' server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.ts | head -20
```

## 3. P1 Objective 2 — Dashboard Parameter Propagation

This objective verified that parameters defined in the KG flow correctly through the broker into the tRPC router and are consumable by the frontend.

### 3.1 Verification Tests

| Test | File | What It Proves |
|------|------|----------------|
| PUT /active-response body params in KG | `paramPropagation.test.ts` | Body params (command, arguments, alert, custom) exist in KG for the active-response endpoint |
| POST /agents body params in KG | `paramPropagation.test.ts` | Body params (name, ip, force_time) exist in KG for the agents creation endpoint |
| Syscollector packages params match KG | `paramPropagation.test.ts` | Query params for `/syscollector/{agent_id}/packages` match between KG and router Zod schema |
| Dashboard-consumed endpoint truth | `paramPropagation.test.ts` | The `/agents` endpoint's KG params (status, os.platform, q, limit, offset, sort, search, select) are a superset of what the Fleet Command dashboard consumes |
| Source-of-truth documentation | `paramPropagation.test.ts` | Each verified param is tagged with its source: KG (authoritative), router (Zod schema), or broker (runtime coercion) |

**Proof:** The `paramPropagation.test.ts` file contains 8 tests that query the KG database directly and compare parameter sets against the router's Zod schemas. All tests pass.

**Verification:**
```bash
pnpm test -- --reporter=verbose server/wazuh/paramPropagation.test.ts
```

---

## 4. P1 Objective 3 — Agent Introspection Parity

This objective confirmed that the agentic pipeline's parameter introspection reflects the current KG state, not stale cached data.

### 4.1 Verification Tests

| Test | File | What It Proves |
|------|------|----------------|
| Pipeline retrieves current KG params | `agentIntrospection.test.ts` | `searchGraph()` returns parameters that match the live KG, not a hardcoded list |
| No stale cache overrides | `agentIntrospection.test.ts` | The pipeline's `getEndpoints()` call with `llmAllowed: true` returns only SAFE endpoints |
| Payload construction correctness | `agentIntrospection.test.ts` | Given a KG-grounded parameter set, the pipeline constructs a valid Wazuh API call payload |
| Body params visible in introspection | `agentIntrospection.test.ts` | POST/PUT endpoints expose their body params through the same introspection path |
| LLM-safe filtering active | `agentIntrospection.test.ts` | MUTATING and DESTRUCTIVE endpoints are excluded from LLM-bound retrieval |

**Proof:** The `agentIntrospection.test.ts` file contains 10 tests that exercise the pipeline's KG retrieval path. Tests verify that `searchGraph({ llmSafe: true })` excludes dangerous endpoints and that parameter lists match the DB state.

**Verification:**
```bash
pnpm test -- --reporter=verbose server/graph/agentIntrospection.test.ts
```

---

## 5. P1 Objective 4 — Auth/RBAC Negative Tests

This objective added negative authentication tests for the four new security family endpoints, exercised against the real `appRouter` via `appRouter.createCaller({ user: null, ... })`.

### 5.1 Test Matrix

| Endpoint | Test Description | File | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-----------------|------|-------------------|
| `securityRbacRules` | "rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityRbacRules" | `server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts` | Throws TRPCError (UNAUTHORIZED) |
| `securityActions` | "rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityActions" | `server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts` | Throws TRPCError (UNAUTHORIZED) |
| `securityResources` | "rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityResources" | `server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts` | Throws TRPCError (UNAUTHORIZED) |
| `securityCurrentUserPolicies` | "rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityCurrentUserPolicies" | `server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts` | Throws TRPCError (UNAUTHORIZED) |

**Proof:** All four tests live in `server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts` inside the `"wazuh router auth gating"` describe block (lines 321–361). Each test instantiates an unauthenticated caller via `appRouter.createCaller({ user: null, ... })` and asserts the procedure rejects with a thrown error. This is the same pattern used for the existing `status`, `agents`, `managerInfo`, and `securityCurrentUser` auth-negative tests in the same block.

**Note on `server/wazuh/securityAuth.test.ts`:** That file tests the generic `protectedProcedure` middleware in isolation using a simulated `initTRPC` router. It confirms the middleware pattern works, but it is **not** endpoint-level coverage of the real app router. The four tests above provide that endpoint-level coverage.

**Verification:**
```bash
pnpm test -- --reporter=verbose server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts 2>&1 | grep -E "securityRbacRules|securityActions|securityResources|securityCurrentUserPolicies"
```

**Expected output (4 lines, all passing):**
```
 ✓ server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts > wazuh router auth gating > rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityRbacRules
 ✓ server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts > wazuh router auth gating > rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityActions
 ✓ server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts > wazuh router auth gating > rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityResources
 ✓ server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.test.ts > wazuh router auth gating > rejects unauthenticated access to wazuh.securityCurrentUserPolicies
```

## 6. P1 Objective 5 — Regression Fixture

This objective created a JSON fixture of known-good endpoint contracts from Phase 1/2 and wired it into the test suite to catch future hydration regressions.

### 6.1 Fixture Structure

The regression fixture (`server/wazuh/regressionFixture.test.ts`) contains 27 endpoint contracts covering all Phase 1/2 closed gaps. Each contract specifies:

- **Endpoint path** (e.g., `/agents`, `/rules`, `/syscheck/{agent_id}`)
- **Method** (GET)
- **Required parameters** (the minimum set that must exist in the KG)
- **Risk level** (SAFE, MUTATING, or DESTRUCTIVE)
- **Broker config name** (if broker-wired)

### 6.2 Test Coverage

| Test Category | Count | What It Proves |
|---------------|-------|----------------|
| KG endpoint existence | 10 | Each fixture endpoint exists in the KG with correct method and risk level |
| KG parameter completeness | 10 | Required parameters for each fixture endpoint exist in the KG |
| Broker config alignment | 5 | Broker-wired endpoints have configs that match their KG parameter sets |
| UI metadata consumption | 2 | Frontend API explorer can consume the endpoint metadata from the KG |

**Proof:** The fixture is loaded at test time and compared against live KG queries. If a future seed-kg run drops an endpoint or parameter, the regression test fails immediately.

**Verification:**
```bash
pnpm test -- --reporter=verbose server/wazuh/regressionFixture.test.ts
```

## 7. P2 Deferred Objectives — Rationale

The following three objectives were classified as P2 (hardening) and are deferred to a future sprint. Each deferral is justified below.

### 7.1 Objective 6 — KG Schema Versioning

> **Gap:** The KG database has no version metadata. If the Wazuh spec is upgraded (e.g., v4.15), there is no automated way to detect schema drift or migrate the KG.

**Deferral rationale:** The current deployment targets a single Wazuh version (v4.14.3). Schema versioning becomes critical only when multi-version support is required or when the spec is upgraded. The `seed-kg.mjs --drop` flag provides a clean re-seed path that is sufficient for single-version deployments. Adding a `kg_meta` table with `spec_version`, `seeded_at`, and `schema_hash` columns is the recommended implementation when this objective is prioritized.

**Risk if deferred:** Low. The seeder is idempotent with `--drop`. A spec upgrade without re-seeding would leave stale data, but the deterministic seed count tests would catch the discrepancy.

### 7.2 Objective 7 — Full Error Contract Parity

> **Gap:** The KG stores 9 error patterns from the spec, but the router does not enforce spec-compliant error shapes for all failure modes. Some Wazuh API errors are passed through as raw strings rather than structured `{ error, data }` envelopes.

**Deferral rationale:** The current error handling is functionally correct — all errors are caught, logged, and returned as TRPCErrors with appropriate codes (UNAUTHORIZED, INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, BAD_REQUEST). The gap is in error shape normalization, not error detection. The frontend already handles both structured and unstructured error responses gracefully. Implementing full error contract parity requires mapping all 9 KG error patterns to tRPC error codes and ensuring the response shape matches the spec's error schema for each endpoint.

**Risk if deferred:** Low. Analysts see error messages. The shape inconsistency affects only programmatic error consumers (e.g., the agentic pipeline), which already handles both formats.

### 7.3 Objective 8 — Syscollector Staleness/TTL UX

> **Gap:** Syscollector data can be stale if an agent has not reported recently. The UI does not indicate data freshness or provide a "last updated" timestamp for syscollector panels.

**Deferral rationale:** Implementing staleness indicators requires either (a) comparing the agent's `lastKeepAlive` timestamp against the syscollector data's collection time, or (b) adding a TTL-based freshness badge to each syscollector panel. Both approaches require additional Wazuh API calls per render cycle, which conflicts with the "no silent automation" and rate-limiting constraints. The recommended implementation is a lightweight freshness badge that uses the agent's existing `lastKeepAlive` field (already fetched by Fleet Command) without additional API calls.

**Risk if deferred:** Medium. Analysts may act on stale syscollector data without realizing it. Mitigated by the existing "last keep alive" column in the Fleet Command agent table.

## 10. Architectural Safety Verification

### 10.1 Hard Gates Status

| Gate | Function | Status | Test Count |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Gate 2A: No KG → No Plan | `gateNoKgNoPlan()` | **ACTIVE** | 8 |
| Gate 2B: Safe-Only Execution | `gateSafeOnly()` | **ACTIVE** | 16 |
| Gate 2C: Provenance Required | `gateProvenanceRequired()` | **ACTIVE** | 6 |

### 10.2 Safety Invariants

| Invariant | Verification |
|-----------|-------------|
| No write endpoints in router | All 113 procedures use `wazuhGet()` (GET only) |
| No raw token passthrough | Wazuh auth tokens stored in server-side `wazuhClient.ts`, never in tRPC responses |
| No browser-direct Wazuh calls | All Wazuh traffic proxied through `/api/trpc/wazuh.*` |
| LLM-safe retrieval | `searchGraph({ llmSafe: true })` excludes MUTATING/DESTRUCTIVE endpoints at DB level |
| Object-source leak prevention | `gateSafeOnly()` sanitizes object-shaped graph sources, strips `dangerousEndpoints` |
| Broker warnings visible | All 18 broker-wired procedures attach `_brokerWarnings` to responses |

## 12. UI → Router Schema Parity (NEW — v1.1.0)

This section documents the deterministic UI param parity audit added in the truth hygiene sprint.

### 12.1 Audit Script

**Script:** `scripts/audit-ui-param-parity.mjs`

The script statically parses every `trpc.wazuh.*` callsite in the client source tree and compares the keys passed against the router's Zod input schemas. It classifies every optional parameter as **Surfaced** (UI control exists), **Constant** (hardcoded by design), or **Not supported** (explicitly omitted).

**Verification:**
```bash
node scripts/audit-ui-param-parity.mjs
# Generates: docs/ui-param-parity-report.md + docs/ui-param-parity.json
```

### 12.2 CI Guard

**Test:** `server/wazuh/uiParamParity.test.ts` (9 tests)

The CI guard runs the audit script fresh and asserts:
- Zero violations (no unknown keys, no missing required params)
- All consumed procedures exist in the router
- Report and JSON artifact are consistent
- No unresolved dynamic inputs
- Callsite and procedure counts remain in expected ranges

**Verification:**
```bash
pnpm test -- --run server/wazuh/uiParamParity.test.ts
# Expected: 9 tests pass
```

### 12.3 Parity Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total callsites | 168 |
| Unique procedures consumed | 113 of 113 |
| Parameters surfaced in UI | 95 |
| Parameters hardcoded/constant | 116 |
| Parameters not supported (classified) | 600 |
| Violations | 0 |
| Unconsumed procedures (backend-only) | 0 |

All 113 procedures now have at least one UI callsite. The 49 procedures that were backend-only at v1.1.0 have been wired to UI pages in subsequent sprints. See §14 for the updated disposition.

## 13. P2 Spec Gap Disposition (5 endpoints)

The original gap report (March 4, 2026) identified 5 endpoints as P2 — Medium priority. All 5 are now implemented in the router. This section provides explicit classification with rationale for each.

| # | Wazuh API Path | tRPC Procedure | Classification | Rationale |
|---|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | `GET /agents/summary` | `agentsSummary` | **Covered by equivalent** | Data already surfaced via `agentSummaryStatus` (active/disconnected/pending/never_connected counts) + `agentSummaryOs` (OS distribution). The `/agents/summary` endpoint returns the same counters. No unique data loss. |
| 2 | `GET /manager/version/check` | `managerVersionCheck` | **Implemented, UI deferred** | Procedure exists with full Zod validation. UI panel deferred because version-check requires outbound connectivity from the Wazuh manager to the update server, which many air-gapped SOC deployments block. Will surface in System Status page when connectivity-aware UX is designed. |
| 3 | `GET /manager/configuration/{component}/{configuration}` | `managerComponentConfig` | **Implemented, UI deferred** | Procedure exists with `component` + `configuration` path params validated via Zod. UI deferred because the component/configuration taxonomy (e.g., `analysis/global`, `auth/auth`, `wmodules/wmodules`) requires a curated picker — raw string inputs would confuse analysts. Will surface in System Status page with a guided component selector. |
| 4 | `GET /security/config` | `securityConfig` | **Implemented, UI deferred** | Procedure exists. Returns Wazuh security module configuration (auth_token_exp_timeout, rbac_mode, etc.). UI deferred to Security Explorer expansion — low analyst urgency since these values rarely change and are set by Wazuh admins, not SOC operators. |
| 5 | `GET /security/users/me` | `securityCurrentUser` | **Internal use only** | Procedure exists and is actively consumed by the auth subsystem (`WazuhGuard` component) to verify the current Wazuh API user context. Not a dashboard endpoint — it's infrastructure. The equivalent user-facing data is surfaced via the Manus OAuth `auth.me` procedure. |

**Verification:**
```bash
# All 5 procedures exist in the router
grep -c 'agentsSummary:\|managerVersionCheck:\|managerComponentConfig:\|securityConfig:\|securityCurrentUser:' server/wazuh/wazuhRouter.ts
# Expected: 5
```

**Summary:**

| Classification | Count | Procedures |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| Covered by equivalent route | 1 | `agentsSummary` |
| Implemented, UI deferred (with rationale) | 3 | `managerVersionCheck`, `managerComponentConfig`, `securityConfig` |
| Internal use only (not dashboard) | 1 | `securityCurrentUser` |

All 5 P2 spec gaps are now explicitly dispositioned. None are "floating without classification."

## 14. Remaining Gap Disposition (formerly 49 backend-only procedures — now all wired)

> **Update (v1.2.0):** All 49 procedures listed below have been wired to UI callsites in subsequent sprints. The wiring ledger (`docs/wiring-ledger.json`) confirms 113/113 parity. The table below preserves the original disposition for audit trail, with each procedure’s current wiring location noted.

### 14.2 Summary (updated v1.2.0)

| Disposition | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| **Wired to UI** | **49** |
| Backend-only (no UI callsite) | **0** |

All 49 formerly backend-only procedures now have at least one UI callsite. The wiring ledger (`docs/wiring-ledger.json`) confirms 113/113 parity with 168 total callsites across 20 client source files.
